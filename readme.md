## SMS/Email Spam Classifier

This GitHub repository contains the code for a SMS/Email spam classifier project. The project aims to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham) using machine learning techniques.

### Overview

The SMS Spam Classifier project utilizes the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to classify SMS messages. The algorithm has been chosen based on its superior accuracy and precision during the model evaluation phase.

### Features

- The code uses natural language processing techniques to preprocess the SMS messages and extract relevant features.
- It trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier using a labeled dataset of SMS messages.
- The trained model is capable of predicting whether a given SMS message is spam or ham.
- The project includes a user-friendly interface developed using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the classifier in real-time.

### Getting Started

To get started with the SMS Spam Classifier project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-classifier.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Streamlit application: `streamlit run app.py`

### Dataset

The project utilizes a labeled dataset of SMS messages, where each message is classified as spam or ham. The dataset is used for training and evaluating the classifier.

### Model Evaluation

During the model evaluation phase, various machine learning algorithms were tested, including Multinomial Naive Bayes, to identify the best-performing algorithm. Multinomial Naive Bayes showed higher accuracy and precision compared to the other algorithms, making it the preferred choice for the SMS spam classifier.

### Future Improvements

There are several potential areas for future improvement and expansion of the SMS Spam Classifier project:

- Explore different algorithms and compare their performance for SMS spam classification.
- Implement additional preprocessing techniques, such as stemming or lemmatization, to further enhance feature extraction.
- Incorporate more advanced natural language processing techniques, such as word embeddings or deep learning models.
- Increase the size of the labeled dataset to improve the model's generalization and performance.
